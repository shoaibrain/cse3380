# (a) Create a Python script that generates a plot of the L1 distance versus L2
# distance. That is, the y-axis represents the output of each function and the
# x-axis is the vector uâˆ’v. To keep visualization simple, generate a range of
# values from -1 to 1 as your x values.
def _plot():
 pass

# (b) Create a function in Python that, given two vectors, computes the L1 and L2
# loss. The loss should be printed out.
def _loss(L1,L2):
 pass

# (c) To test the above function, randomly generate two sets of scalars and pass
# them as input to your function.
